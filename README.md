## AI ChatBot

Python Flask project to create an AI chatbot using an open-source model from Hugging Face, with tasks divided for a team.

This project uses the **Hugging Face Inference API**, which allows you to use powerful models for free without needing to download them or have a powerful computer.

### **Project Outline: Flask Chatbot with Hugging Face**

#### **1. Project Goal üéØ**

To build a web chatbot that uses a free, open-source AI model from Hugging Face to generate responses. The final product will be a simple, clean web page where a user can have a conversation with the AI.

#### **2. Key Technologies**

- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **AI Service**: **Hugging Face Inference API** (Free Tier)
- **Python Libraries**: `requests`, `python-dotenv`

---

### **3. Implementation Plan**

This project is broken into four main phases to ensure a smooth workflow.

#### **Phase 1: Basic Flask Server & UI**

The first step is to create the skeleton of the application.

- Set up a basic Flask server in an `app.py` file.
- Create a simple HTML page (`index.html`) for the chat interface. This should include a chat history area, a text input box, and a "Send" button.
- Style the page using CSS (`style.css`) to make it look like a chat window.



#### **Phase 2: Frontend-Backend Communication**

Next, make the chat interface functional without any AI.

- Write JavaScript (`main.js`) to capture the user's message when they click "Send".
- Display the user's message in the chat history.
- Use the `fetch()` API in JavaScript to send the message to a new Flask route (e.g., `/chat`).
- In Flask, create the `/chat` route that receives the message and returns a simple, hardcoded response like `"I received your message."`
- The JavaScript should then display this hardcoded response in the chat window.

#### **Phase 3: Hugging Face API Integration**

This is where you connect the real AI.

- **Choose a Model**: Browse the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) and choose a suitable conversational model. A great starting point is **`google/gemma-2b-it`** or **`microsoft/DialoGPT-medium`**.
- **Get an API Token**: Create a free Hugging Face account and get a User Access Token from your settings.
- **Secure Your Token**: Store your token in a `.env` file to keep it safe and out of your code.
- **Update the Backend**: In your `/chat` route, write the Python code using the `requests` library to make a `POST` request to the model's Inference API endpoint. You'll need to include your API token in the authorization header.
- **Process the Response**: Parse the JSON response from Hugging Face to extract the generated text and send it back to your frontend.

### **4. Task Breakdown for 6 Students**

This project is perfect for a team of six, allowing students to specialize in different areas of web development.

#### **Pair 1: The Frontend Team (UI/UX)** üé®

This pair is responsible for everything the user sees and interacts with.

- **Student 1 (HTML & Structure)**: Write the `index.html` file. Structure the chat window, message list, and input form using semantic HTML.
- **Student 2 (CSS & Styling)**: Own the `style.css` file. Design the chat bubbles, choose a color scheme, and make the interface responsive and visually appealing.

**Shared Goal**: Create an intuitive and attractive user interface.

#### **Pair 2: The Backend Team (Flask Core)** ‚öôÔ∏è

This pair builds the server-side foundation of the application.

- **Student 3 (Server & Routing)**: Set up the `app.py` file, initialize the Flask application, and create the routes for the home page (`/`) and the chat endpoint (`/chat`).
- **Student 4 (Request & Response Handling)**: Implement the logic within the routes to handle incoming `POST` requests from the frontend. Manage the data flow, ensuring that user input is correctly received and that responses are sent back in the proper JSON format.

**Shared Goal**: Build a stable and reliable server that connects the frontend to the AI logic.

#### **Pair 3: The AI Integration Team (API Connectors)** üß†

This pair focuses on the "smart" part of the chatbot.

- **Student 5 (API Research & Logic)**: Research suitable conversational models on the Hugging Face Hub. Write the core Python function that takes a user's message, formats it correctly, and sends it to the Hugging Face Inference API.
- **Student 6 (Security & Data Parsing)**: Responsible for securely managing the Hugging Face API token using a `.env` file. They will also write the code to parse the complex JSON response from the API, extract the meaningful text, and handle potential errors (like if the API is down).

**Shared Goal**: Successfully connect to the Hugging Face API and reliably retrieve AI-generated responses.

## Project Ideas
